# NOD-MEEG: Natural Objects Dataset of MEG & EEG

This repository contains code for preprocessing, validation, and plotting functions for the **NOD-MEEG** dataset.

## Overview

This repository includes scripts to reproduce the neuroimaging analyses presented in the NOD-MEEG. The structure is organized into three main subfolders:

- **[assets](https://github.com/colehank/NOD-MEEG/tree/main/assets)**: Contains models for preprocessing and Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) of NOD-fMRI data.
- **[scripts](https://github.com/colehank/NOD-MEEG/tree/main/scripts)**: Houses the main code for preprocessing, plotting, and technical validation.
- **[src](https://github.com/colehank/NOD-MEEG/tree/main/src)**: Includes general-purpose functions and classes used for preprocessing and technical validation in this study.
